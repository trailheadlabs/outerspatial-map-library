## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a Trailhead Labs open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions, just [shoot us an email](mailto:hi@trailheadlabs.com).

## Coding conventions

OuterSpatial Map Library uses [JavaScript Semi-Standard Style](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard).

The `.csscomb.json` file should be used to format CSS.
